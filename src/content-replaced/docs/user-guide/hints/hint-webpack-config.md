# webpack configuration hints set (`webpack-config`)

`webpack-config` contains set of hints to check if your webpack configuration
file (`webpack.config.js`) has the most recommended configuration.

## Why is this important?

If you are building an app or a website using webpack, you
need to be sure that your configuration is the best for your needs.

## Hints

* [webpack-config/config-exists][config-exists]
* [webpack-config/is-installed][is-installed]
* [webpack-config/is-valid][is-valid]
* [webpack-config/module-esnext-typescript][module-esnext-typescript]
* [webpack-config/modules-false-babel][modules-false-babel]
* [webpack-config/no-devtool-in-prod][no-devtool-in-prod]

## How to use these hints?

To use it you will have to install it via `npm`:

```bash
npm install @hint/hint-webpack-config
```

Note: You can make `npm` install it as a `devDependency` using the
`--save-dev` parameter, or to install it globally, you can use the
`-g` parameter. For other options see [`npm`'s
documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install).

And then activate it via the [`.hintrc`][hintrc] configuration file:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "hints": {
        "webpack-config/config-exists": "error",
        "webpack-config/is-installed": "error",
        "webpack-config/is-valid": "error",
        "webpack-config/module-esnext-typescript": "error",
        "webpack-config/no-devtool-in-prod": "error",
        ...
    },
    "parsers": ["webpack-config", "typescript-config"],
    ...
}
```
